## Flight Delays Prediction
* Pioneered a machine learning pipeline to predict the severity of a flightâ€™s delay (1M+ flights)
* Performted EDA, feature engineering, cross validation, and hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV) to optimize a LightGBM model that achieved 95%
* Tools: Python (numpy, pandas, sklearn, LightGBM, XGBoost, GridSearchCV)
